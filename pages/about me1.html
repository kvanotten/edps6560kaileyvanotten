<p>I am so excited to have the opportunity to teach your student this year! I am looking forward to see how your student will progress throughout their 2nd grade year!

This will be my second year teaching 2nd grade. I received my Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education as well as an endorsement in English as a second language at the University of Utah. I am currently getting my Masters at the University of Utah in Educational Technology. 

    I believe that learning is endless. Students are constantly making progress in their learning and creating new memories through their learning. I want my students to be excited to come to school each day and be ready to learn something new. Both through life and in this class, students will have many new experiences and create new memories. Learning is continuous and together we can create the best learning experience for our students. </p>
